--This mock data represents a fictional restaurant dataset created for analytical purposes. 
/*This project analysis is to showcase my skills in analyzing customer data to gain insights into customer behavior, identify high-revenue demographics, 
and assess product category preferences. The analysis includes segmenting income and age groups to determine their contribution to revenue, identifying top-selling items 
over a 6-month period, and comparing product preferences across different membership tiers. These insights help inform business strategies for optimizing sales, 
targeting key customer segments, and improving overall customer retention.*/
